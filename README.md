# Deep-Learning-Challenge

This is my Module 21 - Deep Learning challenge, which consists of one CSV file and a jupyter notebook file(located in the Credit_Risk folder), which are used together to train, create and evaluate a logistic
regression model based on loan risk.

## Contents

- lending_data.csv(CSVfile)

- credit_risk_classification.ipynb(jupyter notbook file)


## About

-The historical lending activity dataset (lending_data) was spilt into training and testing datasets, then a logistic regression model was created using the original data
(training data) and fitted on the testing data to make predictions. The model was then evaluated using a confusion matrix and its classification report.Finally, a report was 
written describing the analysis completed by the logistic regression model, which included and overview of the analysis, results and a summary(the report is located in the jupyter
notebook file as a markdown following the classification report).
