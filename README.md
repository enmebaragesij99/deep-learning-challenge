# Deep-Learning-Challenge

This is my Module 21 - Deep Learning challenge, which consists of two jupyter notebook files and 2 HDF5 files, which are two deep learning models and their exported results.

## Contents

- AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb(jupyter notebook file)

- AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.ipynb(jupyter notbook file)

- AlphabetSoupCharity.h5(HDF5 file)

- AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.h5 (HDF5 file)


## About

-Historical data from organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years was preprocessed followed by the creation of a deep learning model and the training data was used on the model and eventually the model was evaluated using the test data in order to predict wehther applicants  will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Furthermore, the model was optimised using various methods  to achieve higher than 75% accuracy.


Note; I did receive assistance by a Learning Assitant whilst saving my model as a HDF5 file.
